### professional life
My days are spent as Principal Scientist in Computational Oncology and Community Manager for mobile and technology platforms at [Sage Bionetworks](http://www.sagebase.org). Previously, I worked for seven years as a statistician at the [Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/) primarily in cancer clinical trials and cancer genomics. I have extensive experience working with clinical and genomic data and have long had a passion for exploring innovative ways to make science more open and transparent. My current work involves both innovative research in computational oncology as well as serving as a bridge between biomedical researchers and technology development.

I am an open science advocate and am involved in a number of national efforts to promote a research ecosystem where participants are treated as partners in the research process. I have also been an [invited speaker at a number of national and international events](/presentations) to share my experiences living at the intersection of biomedical research and technology.

### personal life
When not consumed by the 'professional life' above, I enjoy traveling, hanging with family and friends, spinning vinyl, playing cards, golfing, drinking good coffee or wine (depending on the hour of the day), and barbequing. I live in Seattle, WA and am lucky to have four fruit trees which keep me busy in the summer months. I am a Minnesota native, and am proud of my hearty heritage (see below). If it were socially acceptable, I would be barefoot all day long. If you catch me at the airport traveling back from a (formal) talk, [you'll often see me](/images/travelSandals-small.jpg) still in my dress slacks and shirt, but changed into sandals instead of dress shoes. That's just how I roll.
